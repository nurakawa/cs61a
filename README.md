# CS61A Fall 2013

This repository contains my solutions to the homeworks and labs of the U.C. Berkeley course [CS61A Fall 2023](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa23/), Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. 

The course is based on the online book [Composing Programs](https://www.composingprograms.com/).
